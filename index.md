# RFP - Fieldhouse App

## Background

As the Assistant Vice-President of Student Affairs for Campus Recreation, I want a beautiful, useful app that would be available to visitors to our new Carl & Cheryl Hughes Fieldhouse.  
This app should be university-branded, attractive, and easy-to-use. It should be designed to 
appear similar to the Fieldhouse website at https://www.nwmissouri.edu/HughesFieldhouse/.  
The initial app will be primary view-only, providing users access to information that might include PDF files (or images) of the Fieldhouse floor-plans, event schedules, live camera feeds, and more. 
I will provide or will be able to direct you to the people who can provide the PDF files, images, and videos, that we decide to include. Event schedules may be included as a link to the information provided on the main website. I am looking for suggestions on what other information might be useful to our visitors and possibly administrators.  Advanced options might include tracking the number of visits by  app users while maintaining user confidentiality. 

## Statement of Purpose

Create an app useful to visitors to our new field house.  

## Functional Requirements

The app will primary have roles for visitors.  At this point, no need for a login is expected, but 
this may be updated in the future. Users should be able to use the app across as many types of devices as possible, including iPhones, Android phones, Windows phones, and laptops running Windows or Linux-based operating systems. The app must be responsive, accommodating the different sizes and aspect ratios of these devices. The app should be available when the visitor has wifi or a mobile data connection. 
The visitor should be asked if they would like to install the app on their mobile device. If so, the app should be available and interactive even when the device is offline. The app should include an attractive splash screen and/or immediate on capabilities. An optional, but nice functionality might be the ability to push information out to our app users (e.g., sending reminders about major events. If possible, we might request the ability to access the visitor's location information to see if they are currently on the grounds and respond differently than if the user is remote. Security and the integrity of our Northwest brand must be addressed. All user experiences should be attractive and complement our Northwest online presence. 

## Additional Requirements

The app must work on laptops and mobile devices across as broad a range as possible. 

## Bidder Qualifications

Bidders must be able to:

1. Specify the project I have suggested and review the details with me before beginning.
1. Be able to implement the suggested project within times agreed to in the contract.

## Metrics

Specified in the contract.

## Schedule

* Phase 1: Rapid architecture/data/UI design & project charter competition (2 weeks)
* Phase 2: Synthesis of design (2 weeks)
* Phase 2: Contract completion & delivery (1 week)
* Phase 2: Contract finalization (1 week)
* Phase 3: Implementation, testing, and review of iterative MVPs (~7-8 weeks)
* Phase 4: Final design and implementation plan for next semester (~2 weeks)

## Project Conception and Initialization

Phase 1 will include the development of a detailed Project Charter to be presented in Markdown or HTML with in-line images and tables (not Word). It will include at least the following sections. 

* Overview
* Purpose
* Benefits
* Epics / Stories / Tasks
* Acceptance criteria checklist
* Contract scope / budget / schedule
* User experience sketches
* Stack information 
* E-R diagram 
* Sample data
* Risks and assumptions

## Project Definition and Planning

Phase 2 will include the development of a detailed contract for this semester's remaining work.  
It must be presented in Markdown or HTML with in-line images and tables (not Word).
The contract will specify:

* Overview
* Purpose
* Benefits
* Epics / Stories / Tasks
* Acceptance criteria checklist
* Functional requirements
* Performance requirements (within range of values)
* Other requirements
* User experience sketches
* E-R diagram 
* Sample data
* Stack description (including expected tools, technologies, libraries, more)
* Risks and assumptions
* Deliverable artifacts 
* Scope
* Milestones
* Schedule and Iteration Plan
* Budget
* Test plan with requirements
* Bid amount

## Payment, Incentives, and Containment

If contract requirements are met 1 7-day week ahead of schedule to the satisfaction of the client, students are eligible for a 2.5% bonus (based on the total number of points possible) for the associated deliverable. 

## Terms and Conditions

The application should be Northwest branded and developed to provide a positive association with the university. All code and applications will be licensed in accordance with university guidelines (which may be Apache 2.0 and should be verified). 

## Evaluation Criteria

The client will provide feedback throughout the development process. While the client may ask for a requirement change, if granted it would require a modification of the contract with commensurate elimination of other requirements. This would only be applied it there was a critical change in core functionality.  Typically, requirements changes will be documented and would serve as the basis of a change contract. 

The user interface will be evaluated on aesthetics as well as ability to perform a task.  There will be a single major review of every new interface screen.  Good choices will be made for images/color/sound. Screen space will be used well.  Controls will have signifiers indicating where and how operations/input can occur. Input will be validated. Appropriate feedback will be employed.  The interface will avoid requiring multiple clicks for common operations.  Confirmation is not required if an operation is easy to undo.  Confirmation is required for operations that cannot be undone.  Default values will be provided for fields.  Do not loose what has been typed if there are errors.  This app will be ADA compliant. If specified in the contract, support for internationalization may be required.

Note: Correct functionality is not a requirement change.
